* This contains certain files copied from https://alkesgroup.broadinstitute.org/LDSCORE
  needed to run basic LD score regression analysis.
  Some of this data is derived, e.g. ``1000G_EUR_Phase3_baseline_split/base`` is extracted 
  from ``1000G_Phase3_baseline_ldscores.tgz`` using just the ``base`` column (i.e. total LD score).
